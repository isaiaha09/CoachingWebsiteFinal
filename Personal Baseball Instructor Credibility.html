            My Credibility
        </h1>

        <p class="a">
            I attended Rio Mesa High School and played baseball all 4 years and was on Varsity my Junior and Senior Year. As a senior, I earned 1st-Team All League. I have 4 years of collegiate baseball experience.
            Two being in Junior College, and the last two being at the 4-year college level NAIA. I graduated in Spring of 2024 with my B.S. in Computer Science and now currently a private baseball instructor at S.I.S. Athletics in Ventura, CA.

                This is FieldLevel. It is a recruiting app for multiple sports, including baseball, 
                that college coaches use to seek out players for their schools. 
                There are other recruiting apps such as this one, however this one 
                is free unlike some others that I had encountered while trying to get recruited in high school.
                I created a profile on here for those that need help on getting recruited. Use my profile as a template
                and submit as many highlights and workout videos as possible. You can also view the highlights that I have on there
                that showcases my skills during my time at Avila University.

                    This is Baseball Reference. It is a baseball encyclopedia that lists baseball players from 
                    the MLB all the way down to players that played at the Juco Level and shows the legitimacy of players that played
                    in college and beyond. If you click the link, my 
                    profile on baseball reference will be displayed as well as my stats at AU in KcMO. My stats are not 
                    the greatest and I unfortunately did not get the chance to redeem myself at the collegiate level. I did finish 
                    a lot better my second year there, but I hope I get the chance to play again in an Independent 
                    League (Professional) in 2025.

            <strong>Strength & Agility Background</strong>
            
            <p>
                Growing up, I was always one of the smallest, if not, the smallest on the team. 
                I capped out at 5'7 around my sophomore/junior year of high school, so I knew that 
                I would have to show out and perform better than those that were bigger than me if 
                I wanted to continue playing. I also knew that I needed to gain a little bit of size 
                and strength in order to have a chance at competing. The video you see above is my max 
                front-squat of 365lbs at 170lbs bodyweight. A few of the many feats that I've accomplished include:
                a 6.7s 60 meter dash, a 405lbs conventional deadlift, and a 225lbs bench press for 10 reps.
