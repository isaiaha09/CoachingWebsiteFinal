            <p>
                My name is Isaiah Alvarez.
                I am collegiate baseball player retiree
                and a current private baseball instructor at S.I.S. Athletics in Ventura, California. I have future 
                aspirations of eventually playing independent baseball in 2025, but for the time being, I am focused
                on helping baseball players of all ages get better at their craft and obtain their goals both short and 
                long term. I was mainly an outfielder growing up, as that is where I played 
                throughout my college career. I also have little bit of high school experience in pitching, middle infield, and catching. 
                I played baseball all 4 years of high school and graduated from Rio Mesa in 2019. I was on Varsity my
                junior and senior year with my senior year earning 1st Team All-League. I attended and played baseball 
                at Oxnard College for my first 2 years. From there, I transferred and finished my collegiate baseball 
                career and education at Avila University in Kansas City, Missouri with a B.S. in Computer Science. I want to help 
                these young players become knowledgeable at the game as well as talented. I encourage parents and players of all ages
                to contact me with whatever questions you may have. I am an open book, so I please insist 
                on you reaching out to me. I am looking forward to what the future has in store for the players that I
                work with.
